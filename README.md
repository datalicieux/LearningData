# LearningData
A collection of my statistical learning projects

This page intends to become a collection of my statistical learning projects. While diving deeper into the universe of learning algorithms, I will expose some of my projects here. As a start, it presents one project from a statistical learning course. I built a model to forecast the risk of Violence Against Civilians across Mali. 

Of course, I am very happy to receive your feedback on any of my projects!
